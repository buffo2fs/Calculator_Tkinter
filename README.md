# Calculator_Tkinter
This repository contains two simple calculator projects built with Python and Tkinter (the standard GUI library).
The goal is to demonstrate how to create basic graphical user interfaces and progressively improve their design.

Tkinter_BasicStructure.py

A basic calculator with a simple window.

User enters an expression (e.g., 2+5*3) and clicks Calculate.

The result is displayed below.

If an invalid expression is entered, an error message is shown.


Tkinter_ColourCalculator.py

An improved version of the calculator with a more modern look.

Features:

Dark background

Styled button with hover effects

Centered input field

Colored output:

Green if calculation succeeds

Red if an error occurs

How to Run:

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
Tkinter comes pre-installed with Python, so no extra libraries are required.

Run one of the calculators:

python Tkinter_BasicStructure.py

or

python Tkinter_ColourCalculator.py
